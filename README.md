[![Diamond Pattern](https://img.shields.io/badge/diamond%20pattern-EIP--2535-orange)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)

A decentralized real estate investment platform built on Ethereum using the **Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535)** that enables property developers to raise funds and investors to participate in real estate opportunities with milestone-based fund releases.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform uses a **modular diamond pattern** architecture for scalability and upgradeability:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Diamond.sol** | Proxy contract that routes calls to facets |
| **AssetrixStorage.sol** | Shared storage layout for all facets |
| **AdminFacet.sol** | Ownership, initialization, and admin functions |
| **PropertyFacet.sol** | Property creation, management, and queries |
| **InvestmentFacet.sol** | Investment, payout, refund, and token operations |
| **MilestoneFacet.sol** | Milestone workflow and fund release management |
| **TransactionFacet.sol** | Transaction recording and history |
| **DiamondLoupeFacet.sol** | Diamond structure querying (EIP-2535 standard) |
