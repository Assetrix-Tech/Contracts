# Assetrix Investment Platform

A decentralized real estate investment platform built on Ethereum using the **Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535)** that enables property developers to raise funds and investors to participate in real estate opportunities with milestone-based fund releases.

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Diamond Pattern Implementation
The platform uses a **modular diamond pattern** architecture for scalability and upgradeability:

- **Diamond.sol**: Proxy contract that routes calls to facets
- **AssetrixStorage.sol**: Shared storage layout for all facets
- **AdminFacet.sol**: Ownership, initialization, and admin functions
- **PropertyFacet.sol**: Property creation, management, and queries
- **InvestmentFacet.sol**: Investment, payout, refund, and token operations
- **MilestoneFacet.sol**: Milestone workflow and fund release management
- **TransactionFacet.sol**: Transaction recording and history

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Modular**: Each facet handles specific functionality
- ‚úÖ **Upgradeable**: Individual facets can be upgraded independently
- ‚úÖ **Gas Efficient**: Only deploy what you need
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Easy to add new features as new facets
- ‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
