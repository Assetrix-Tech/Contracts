# Assetrix Investment Platform - Simple Guide

## What is Assetrix?

Assetrix is like a **digital real estate investment platform** that connects property developers with investors using blockchain technology. Think of it as "Kickstarter for real estate" but with smart contracts ensuring everyone's money is safe and transparent.

## How It Works - The Simple Version

### üèóÔ∏è **Step 1: Developer Creates a Project**
- A real estate developer wants to build a luxury apartment building
- They create a project on Assetrix with details like:
  - Project description and location
  - Total cost needed (e.g., $100 million)
  - Expected return on investment (e.g., 15% per year)
  - Investment duration (e.g., 12 months)
  - Minimum investment amount (e.g., $10,000)

### üí∞ **Step 2: Investors Fund the Project**
- Multiple investors can invest in the project
- Each investor can put in as little as $10,000
- The project only starts when it reaches 100% funding
- All money is held securely in smart contracts

### üè¢ **Step 3: Project Development with Milestones**
The developer must complete the project in stages (milestones):

**Milestone 1: Foundation (25% of funds)**
- Developer requests $25 million to start foundation work
- Platform admin reviews and approves
- Developer gets the money and starts construction
- After completion, admin inspects and marks it done

**Milestone 2: Building Structure (30% of funds)**
- Developer requests $30 million for building structure
- Process repeats with inspection and approval

**Milestone 3: Interior Systems (25% of funds)**
- Developer requests $25 million for electrical, plumbing, etc.

**Milestone 4: Final Finishing (20% of funds)**
- Developer requests $20 million for final touches

### üí∏ **Step 4: Investors Get Returns**
- During the project: Investors receive quarterly payments (ROI)
- At the end: Investors get their original investment back plus final profits

## Real-World Example: Marina Heights Tower

### The Project
- **Location**: Dubai, UAE
- **Type**: Luxury 50-story residential tower
- **Total Cost**: $100 million
- **Expected Return**: 15% per year

```
